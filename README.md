# Niobium-Blockchain-Interoperability
Niobium main functionality is to connect multiple blockchains andbridge the gap between the decentralised ecosystem flourishing in these blockchains.
Niobium leverages the use of interoperable niobium blockchain interoperability to transfer data between blockchains. 
Just as niobium blockchain interoperability have successfully connected blockchains with the outside data, Niobium interoperable will connect the blockchains by allowing the flow of information between the chains.
Niobium is built to be secure and trustworthy through a range of incentives and penalties for the node operators.
Niobium is being built to support multiple blockchains including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart chain MATIC, Tron etc.
Niobium includes two approaches to achieve interoperability to cover a wide spectrum of use cases to be built using this feature.
As per the Niobium approach the data transmission request can originate from either source blockchain or the destination blockchain
